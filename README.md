# Bsplines-Matlab
Most of the files are just the tutorials, for basic understanding.
fittedSpline_and_3rdDerivative, is one of the main folders.
 It has the smoothing of the spline, Reccurence of the knots , 
 The reccurence of the Knots , gives straight edges . which was not there.
 It also contains the plot after optimisation.
 As the lamda value increases the smoothening increases.
 If the number of knots are increased the smoothening as we seen clearly.
